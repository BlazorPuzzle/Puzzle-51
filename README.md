### The Challenge:

This is a simple Blazor Web App with Global Server Interactivity.

The Counter page shows an additional text input that's bound to a string.

When the counter is incremented, the string value is set to the counter's ToString() implementation.

Incrementing the counter updates the input box, until you enter a value then it stops working!

Can you fix it?
